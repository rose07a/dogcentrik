    <h2>Daycare Policies</h2>
    <hr>

    <ul class="grid">
      <li>
        <i class="far fa-bookmark"></i>
        <h4>Bookings</h4>
      <p><strong>Please make your booking as soon as you possibly can.</strong> We do offer last minute bookings. However, the slot is not guaranteed. To book you may call, text, or email Dogcentrik. Many clients text us. Example: "Hi! I need daycare for my dog on the following days, Mon 10/7 and Weds 10/9 with both days being from 9am-6pm, do u have availability on those days and times?"   </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-dog"></i>
        <h4>Drop Off</h4>
      <p><strong>Please call or text 541-654-2367 before arrival.</strong>
         This is for your convenience, so that we can adequately prepare to receive your dog. 
      <strong>Please bring a leash when dropping off. This is for dog safety and owner's convenience. We ask that dog owners take leashes with them after drop-off, unless a different party is picking them up.  In that case leashes may be coiled around the 2 grey hooks located immediately to your upper right after entering the gated area.</strong> Thank you!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-paw"></i>
        <h4>Pick Up</h4>
      <p><strong>Please text us when you and your dog(s) are on your way, even if there is already a pre-agreed upon time.  Due to COVID-19 we kindly ask that you text us at least 10 mins before arriving for both drop off and pick up, so as to do our absolute best in keeping owners distanced from one another.   </strong> Pickup is available after 6:30pm for an extra $10.  <strong>We do not offer pickup after 9:00pm.</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-bone"></i>
        <h4>Meals</h4>
      <p>We offer a breakfast and a dinner feeding with owner-provided food.
         During meal times, dogs are put in an individual area with no other dogs,
          so as to ensure a smooth and calm eating experience. 
          <strong>For first time dogs we have usually seen that they may be not hungry in a new and lively environment. Any uneaten food is discarded. We ask that all dry food/kibble be brought to us in a disposable container. </strong> 
              Please bring any food or treats you'd like your dog to have and let us know
               if they have any food allergies or medication needs.           </p>
      </li>
    <li>
        <i class="fas fa-camera-retro"></i>
        <h4>Photos/updates</h4>
      <p>Free photo and video updates are provided via our Instagram profile and Facebook page. <br>We reserve the right to store, use, and distribute photos and videos of your dog(s), in perpetuity.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-hand-holding-usd"></i>
        <h4>Pricing/discounts:</h4>
      <p>For new clients, we also give a one-time discount of $10 off the total price of 1 daycare session (both a half or full day is ok, either will get the discount!)<br>Discounts and pricing are at the discretion of Dogcentrik.  We do offer a $10 discount for each additional dog you bring into the pack. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-medkit"></i>
        <h4>Vaccines</h4>
      <p>Dogs must be current on the following vaccines:
        <strong>Rabies, DHPP(Parvo), Bordetella(Kennel Cough).  Due to current circumstances we strongly prefer that dog owners send proof of vaccines via email to dogcentrik@gmail.com or we can still accept paper copies.  Please put paper copies in an unsealed envelope and then place the envelope in our mailbox on the front porch.</strong>
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="far fa-file-alt"></i>
        <h4>Breed Restrictions:</h4>
        <p>We do not offer care for German Shepherds, German Shepherd mixes (50% or more) or 
          Belgian Malinois. We apologize for any inconvenience.<br><br>
          "We gladly accept many large breeds!  There is no extra charge if you have a massive dog. The price, scheduling, and procedures are all essentially the same. We highly anticipate caring for your gentle giant! Great Dane, Irish Wolfhound, St. Bernard, Great Pyrenees, and Bernese mountain dog, are just a few examples of the many large/extra large dog breeds we accept into our pack.<br>
          <br>If you are uncertain about whether your dog's breed will be admitted to dog daycare or not please contact us as soon as possible.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i>
        <h4>Leash + Walks</h4>
      <p> Unless other arrangements have been made, we kindly ask that all owners keep their dogs leashed at all times. This is both for dog safety and owner convenience.  What we've seen work best is to leash the dog well ahead of drop-off, before they ever get in the vehicle. We also kindly ask that all leashes are fixed-length, and not the stretchy, adjustable kind as we view them to be unsafe.
      </p>
      <p>We are not liable for any injury, accident, or mishap that occurs to a dog or its owner when disregarding Dogcentrik's leash policy. Furthermore, any dog who is unleashed in (or outside) of the gated area during drop off and/or pick up time is not covered under our insurance policy.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Any dog or dogs brought with a loose fitting, frayed, gummed up, or otherwise nonfunctional collar and/or harness will be ineligible for the dog walk that day.</strong><p/>
      <p>Thank you for being a responsible dog owner and keeping your dog on a leash during drop off and pick up.</p>

    <p>At this time we only offer high quality daycare.</p>

    <h4>2. When is payment for services due?</h4>
    <p>Payment is due upon or before pick up, in the full amount,

    <h4>3. Is a meet n greet required?</h4>
    <p>Dogcentrik is not currently doing any meet n greet or other in-person introductions.  The first day of dog daycare is treated as the meet n greet, with owners able to view the grounds via our Instagram or Facebook page.</p>
