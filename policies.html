    <h2>Daycare Policies</h2>
    <hr>

    <ul class="grid">
      <li>
        <i class="far fa-bookmark"></i>
        <h4>Bookings</h4>
      <p><strong>Please make your booking as soon as you possibly can.</strong> We do offer last minute bookings. However, the slot is not guaranteed. To book you may call, text, or email Dogcentrik. Many clients text us. Example: "Hi! I need daycare for my dog on the following days, Mon 10/7 and Weds 10/9 with both days being from 9am-6pm, do u have availability on those days and times?"   </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-dog"></i>
        <h4>Drop Off</h4>
      <p><strong>Please call or text 541-654-2367 before arrival.</strong> This is for your convenience, so that we can adequately prepare to receive your dog. 
      <strong>Please bring a leash when dropping off. This is for dog safety and owner's convenience.</strong> Thank you!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-paw"></i>
        <h4>Pick Up</h4>
      <p><strong>Please text us even if there is already a pre-agreed upon time.</strong> Pickup is available after 6:30pm for an extra $10.  <strong>we do not offer pickup after 9:00pm.</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-bone"></i>
        <h4>Meals</h4>
      <p>We offer a breakfast and a dinner feeding with owner-provided food. During meal times, dogs are put in an individual area with no other dogs, so as to ensure a smooth and calm eating experience. <strong>For first time clients who would like their dog to eat here we ask that you bring high-quality canned dog food or chicken broth to entice your pooch to eat, as they may be not hungry in a new and lively environment.</strong> Please bring any food or treats you'd like your dog to have to have and let us know if they have any food allergies or medication needs.           </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i>
        <h4>Leash</h4>
      <p> Unless other arrangements have been made, we kindly ask that all owners keep their dogs leashed at all times. This is both for dog safety and owner convenience.  What we've seen work best is to leash the dog well ahead of drop-off, before they ever get in the vehicle. We also kindly ask that all leashes are fixed-length, and not the stretchy, adjustable kind as we view them to be unsafe. Thank you greatly for abiding by this policy.
      </p>
