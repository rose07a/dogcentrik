        <h4>Bookings</h4>
      <p><strong>Please make your booking as soon as you possibly can.</strong> We do offer last minute bookings. However, the slot is not guaranteed.  For best results, please contact us during our normal business hours. To book you may call, text, or email Dogcentrik.  Most clients text us.  Example:
"Hi! I need daycare for my dog on the following days,
Mon 10/7 and Weds 10/9  with both days being from 9am-6pm, do u have availability on those days and times?"</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-dog"></i>
        <h4>Drop Off</h4>
      <p><strong>Please call or text 541-654-2367 before arrival.</strong> This is for your convenience, so that we can adequately prepare to receive your dog.  If a client shows up early or without messaging first there may be a delay.
      <strong>Clients are required to bring a leash every time,</strong> because an unleashed dog on a busy street is unsafe. When parking please do not block driveway, so that other clients and team members may pull in or out of the driveway with their respective vehicles.  To get our attention when you arrive we have several options:<br>
1) wifi or traditional doorbell 
2) knock on front or garage door
3) text "we're here"
4) if all else fails shout "Dogcentrik!" over the eastern side gate.</p>

        <h4>Pick Up</h4>
      <p><strong>Again, please text when you are at least 15-20 minutes away, even if there is already a pre-agreed upon time.</strong> Please bring a leash every time, as we no longer offer curbside service during pickup or drop off unless owner is physically unable to leash and load the dog on their own. Pickups are available after 7pm for an extra $10, <strong>we do not offer pickup after 9:30pm.</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-bone"></i>
        <h4>Meals</h4>
      <p>If needed we offer a breakfast and a dinner feeding with owner-provided food.  We do not feed dogs at lunch as that time is reserved for activities and/or rest from morning play.  All "meal updates" are done in-person during pickup.  All dogs are put in an individual area with no other dogs to disturb their mealtimes. <strong>For first time clients who would like their dog to eat here we ask that you bring high-quality canned dog food or chicken broth to entice your pooch to eat, as they may be not hungry in a new and lively environment.</strong> Please bring any food or treats you'd like your dog to have to have and let us know if they have any food allergies.</p>
