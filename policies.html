        <i class="fas fa-dog"></i>
        <h4>Drop Off</h4>
      <p><strong>Please text 541-654-2367 when you and your dog(s) are on your way.</strong>
         This is for your convenience, so that we can adequately prepare to receive your dog. 
      <strong>Please use a leash when dropping off. This is for dog safety and owner convenience.</strong>
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-paw"></i>
        <h4>Pick Up</h4>
      <p><strong>Please text us when you are on your way,</strong> 
        even if there is already a pre-agreed upon time.  <strong>We kindly ask 
        that you text us at least 5-10 mins before arriving for both drop off and pick up,</strong>
        so we can do our best to have your dog already placed in the pick up area and have pick up be as timely and efficient as possible. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-bone"></i>
        <h4>Meals</h4>
      <p>We offer a breakfast and a dinner feeding with owner-provided food.
         During meal times, dogs are put in an individual area with no other dogs,
          so as to ensure a smooth and calm eating experience. 
           <strong>We ask that all dry food/kibble is brought to us in a container labeled with your dog's name and feeding time. </strong> 
              Please let us know
               if they have any food allergies or medication needs.           </p>
      </li>
    <li>
        <i class="fas fa-camera-retro"></i>
        <h4>Photos/updates</h4>
      <p>Free photo and video updates are provided via our Instagram profile and Facebook page. <br>We reserve the right to store, use, and distribute photos and videos of your dog(s), in perpetuity.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-medkit"></i>
        <h4>Vaccines</h4>
      <p>Dogs must be current on the following vaccines:
        <strong>Rabies, DHPP(Parvo), Bordetella(Kennel Cough). We also require proof of spay/neuter.</strong> 
        Due to current circumstances we prefer that <strong>dog owners send proof of vaccines via email to dogcentrik@gmail.com though we can still accept paper copies.</strong> Please put paper copies on the shelf in the dog-run area, or in the mailbox on the front porch.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="far fa-file-alt"></i>
        <h4>Breed Restrictions:</h4>
        <p>We do not offer care for Chocolate Labs, German Shepherds, German Shepherd mixes (50% or more) or 
          Belgian Malinois. We apologize for any inconvenience.<br><br>
          <!--"We gladly accept many large breeds!  We highly anticipate caring for your gentle giant! Great Dane, Irish Wolfhound, St. Bernard, Great Pyrenees, and Bernese mountain dog, are just a few examples of the many large/extra large dog breeds we accept into our pack.-->
          If you are uncertain about whether your dog's breed will be admitted to dog daycare or not please contact us as soon as possible.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="far fa-file-alt"></i>
        <h4> Spay/neuter policy</h4>
        <p> Unfortunately, as of Oct. 1st 2021 we can no longer accept unaltered animals.  Proof of spay/neuter is required for all first-time dogs here at Dogcentrik.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i>
        <h4>Leash</h4>
      <p> <strong>Thank you for keeping your dog(s) on 
        a fixed-length, good condition leash during drop off and pick up for dog safety and owner convenience. </strong>
          We've seen leashing the dog well ahead of drop-off work best.
           We ask that all leashes are fixed-length, 
           not the stretchy, adjustable type, as we view them to be unsafe.  Dogs are required to wear all proper city and/or county licensing/I.D., and rabies tag.
      </p>
      <p>We are not liable for any injury, accident, or mishap that occurs to a dog or 
        its owner when disregarding Dogcentrik's leash policy. Furthermore, 
        any dog who is unleashed in (or outside) of the gated area during drop off and/or 
        pick up time is not covered under our insurance policy.
      </p>

    <h3 class="title"> FAQs </h3>
    <hr>

    <ul class="grid">
      <li>
    <h4>1. Does Dogcentrik offer overnight boarding?</h4>
    <p>At this time we only offer high quality daycare.</p>
    </li>
      <li>
    <h4>2. When is payment for services due?</h4>
    <p>Payment is due upon or before drop off, in the full amount,
       unless prior arrangements have been made. Many Dogcentrik clients pay using Venmo right
        when they leave their house before dropping off.</p>
    </li>
      <li>
    <h4>3. Is a meet n greet required?</h4>
    <p>Dogcentrik is not currently doing any meet n greet or other in-person introductions.  The first day of dog daycare is treated as the meet n greet, with owners able to view the grounds via our Instagram or Facebook page.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>4. How many dogs are usually there? </h4>
      <p> It averages around 7 or 8 dogs here, give or take.  However, that number is not 
        guaranteed, as we do not have an attendance requirement. </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>5.Do you offer drop-off before 7:30am?  </h4>
        <p> We do not. Our 7:30am opening time is the first available drop-off. </p>
